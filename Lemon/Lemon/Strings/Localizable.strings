You will find my eyes, mouthparts constituting my mouth and biting parts (which also serve to guide food into my mouth), and a pair of antennae, which are sensory organs that allow me to smell, taste, and touch. Like many of my insect friends my head is the most powerful part of my body and is built from several connecting plates. My eyes are known as 'compound eyes' meaning that they are made up of several smaller eyes functioning in unison.";

"description.thorax" = "The thorax, or my mid-section, holds my wings and is the central location of the more powerful muscles used in operating my wings and six legs. My feet-tips contain sticky pads which allow me to cling to various types of surfaces or to clasp onto prey.";

"description.leftWing" = "My left wing comprises the forewing and hindwing. The forewing muscles generate the main power for the flight, whereas the hindwings, with their less powerful muscles generate less power.";

// MARK: - Descriptions

"description.sun" = "The Sun is the primary source of energy for the water cycle. It provides heat, which drives evaporation and influences weather patterns.";

"description.rain" = "Rain occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into droplets heavy enough to fall to the ground. It is a key part of the water cycle, replenishing surface water sources such as lakes, rivers, and oceans.";

"description.infiltration" = "Infiltration is the process by which water on the ground surface enters the soil. It replenishes groundwater and contributes to the water table.";

"description.plant_uptake" = "Plant uptake refers to the process by which plants absorb water from the soil through their roots. This water is used for photosynthesis and other metabolic processes in the plant.";

"description.run_off" = "Runoff occurs when water flows over the ground surface rather than infiltrating into the soil. It can carry pollutants and sediment, impacting water quality in rivers, lakes, and oceans.";

"description.snow" = "Snow forms when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses directly into ice crystals. It accumulates on the ground and may melt into runoff during warmer temperatures, contributing to the water cycle.";

"description.mountain" = "Mountains play a crucial role in the water cycle by capturing moisture from the atmosphere as precipitation. They also serve as reservoirs, storing water in glaciers and snowpacks that release water gradually over time.";

"description.precipitation" = "Precipitation is any form of water, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, that falls from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface. It is a key process in the water cycle, replenishing freshwater sources.";

"description.river" = "Rivers are channels of flowing water that transport water from higher elevations to lower elevations. They play a vital role in the water cycle, carrying runoff and sediment to oceans and other bodies of water.";

"description.condensation" = "Condensation is the process by which water vapor in the atmosphere cools and changes into liquid water droplets. It forms clouds and contributes to precipitation in the water cycle.";

"description.ground_water" = "Groundwater is water that resides beneath the Earth's surface in soil pores and rock fractures. It is a vital source of drinking water and supports ecosystems by sustaining streams, rivers, and wetlands.";

"description.cloud" = "Clouds are visible masses of water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. They play a crucial role in the water cycle, storing and transporting water vapor across the globe.";

"description.ocean" = "Oceans are large bodies of saltwater that cover about 71% of the Earth's surface. They play a central role in the water cycle, absorbing and releasing heat, and exchanging water vapor with the atmosphere.";

"description.transpiration" = "Transpiration is the process by which moisture is released from plants into the atmosphere. It occurs through tiny openings in leaves called stomata and contributes to the water cycle by returning water vapor to the atmosphere.";

"description.evaporation" = "Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas (water vapor) at the surface of the Earth. It is a key component of the water cycle, transferring water from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere.";

"description.arrow" = "Arrows represent the flow of water between different components of the water cycle. They illustrate how water moves through processes such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.";

"description.snow_melt" = "Snow melt is the process by which snow and ice transform into liquid water due to rising temperatures. This melted water contributes to surface water sources and groundwater replenishment, playing a crucial role in the water cycle.";
